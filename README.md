## What is it
Yet another [Rise Of Industry](https://store.steampowered.com/app/671440/Rise_of_Industry/) calculator. You could add several targets to achieve and this tool will 
show buildings needed to get necessary products flow. Also it knows all buildings base costs and such we could 
get payback period as ratio between total costs and products costs.

## Costs
Costs was got from game itself as base costs. Subject to be done make demand adjust for product prices.

## TBD
 - Technologies support like +2 gatherers
 - Support for building efficiency adjust
 
## Known issues
 - Remainders of products does not count for payback calculation at this moment. 
 For example, your target is leather, and livestocks will produce also milks and beef, but they does not count.
